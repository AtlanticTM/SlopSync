# SlopSync Protocol Specification

!!! danger "This tier is generated. Edit the specification, not these pages."

    Every page under **Specification** is produced from `spec/SPEC.md`
    by `docs-site/tools/gen_spec_pages.py`. That file is the normative source and the only
    place to make a change. A hand edit here is overwritten by the next
    build, and `--check` fails the build before that happens.

    There is deliberately no second copy of the normative text on this
    site. An implementer trusts a specification absolutely, so a
    specification that can drift from its source is a defect, not a
    convenience.

**Protocol:** `slopsync/1`  
**Document version:** v1.0 (public)  
**Status:** Normative.  
**Registry of record:** [`registry/registry.yaml`](../reference/registry/index.md) — Appendices [A](appendices.md#appendix-a), [B](appendices.md#appendix-b) and [G](appendices.md#appendix-g) are generated *views* of it. **On any conflict between this document and the registry, the registry wins** ([§5.7](wire-format.md#s5-7)).  
**Companion normative artifacts:** [`schema/catalog.cddl`](schema.md) ([Appendix C](appendices.md#appendix-c)), `vectors/manifest.yaml` ([Appendix F](appendices.md#appendix-f)), `RENDERING.md` (client-rendering conformance, [§19](rendering.md#s19)).  
**Non-normative companions:** `RFC-QUEUE.md` (change history and rationale), `V1-READINESS.md`, [`examples/session-traces.md`](traces.md) ([Appendix E](appendices.md#appendix-e)).

## 0. Reading this document {#s0}

Clause numbering is `§<section>.<subsection>`. Every section header carries `*(normative)*` or `*(informative)*`; where a section is mixed, the exception is named in its header. Numbered lists inside a normative section are normative. Tables are normative unless the section says otherwise.

**Honesty clauses** are normative statements about what this protocol does **not** protect against or does **not** guarantee. They are marked **HONESTY CLAUSE** inline and indexed in [§1.5](foundations.md#s1-5). They are requirements, not caveats: an implementation that presents a protected-sounding UI over one of them is non-conformant.

## The clause pages {#clause-pages}

The document is split by concern. Clause numbering is unchanged: §6.4 is
§6.4 wherever it is published.

## Citing a clause {#citing}

Anchors are derived from clause numbers, never from heading text. A
reworded heading therefore cannot break a citation made from a bug
report or another repository.

| Clause | Anchor | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Section §n | `#sn` | [§11](safety.md#s11) |
| Subsection §n.m | `#sn-m` | [§6.4](session.md#s6-4) |
| Appendix X | `#appendix-x` | [Appendix G](appendices.md#appendix-g) |
| Trace En | `#en` | [E4](traces.md#e4) |

Numbered items and lettered paragraphs inside a clause — §5.8-4, §12.3a —
resolve to their parent clause, which is where they are read from.

## Companion artifacts {#companions}

The specification's companions live beside it in the source repository.
Three of them are published on this site, generated the same way these
pages are:

| Artifact | Where |
|---|---|
| `registry/registry.yaml` — every wire number | [Registry reference](../reference/registry/index.md), generated |
| `examples/session-traces.md` — Appendix E | [Worked session traces](traces.md), generated |
| `schema/catalog.cddl` — Appendix C, the normative catalog encoding | [Catalog schema (CDDL)](schema.md), generated |
| `vectors/manifest.yaml` — Appendix F, golden-vector coverage | source repository |
| `RFC-QUEUE.md`, `V1-READINESS.md` — change history and rationale | source repository |

## The register {#register}

This tier is written in the IEEE and RFC normative register. Numbered
clauses. RFC 2119 keywords. Exact cross-references. It is permitted to be
dense: implementers need exactness more than approachability.

Glossary tooltips are stripped from every page in this tier. In a
normative document every word is normative or visibly marked otherwise,
so a hover definition over a term inside a MUST clause would be a second,
invisible source of meaning. [The Dictionary](../reference/dictionary.md)
stays one click away.

Everything outside this tier is written in the STE register. See
[Contributing](../community/contributing.md).
